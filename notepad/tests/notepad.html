        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The above 'sequence: none' is an editable, multi level bullet list where the relationship between a child node and its parent
            can be specified. Every line has a predicate section (the relationship type, before the ':') and an object section (the value, after the ':').
            With the parent constituting the subject, those three values form a triple.</p>
        <p>The root node exists, but is hidden.  The default predicate for the children of the root node is 'sequence'.
             This predicate would most likely not be displayed in the final UI.  The default predicate for any other child nodes is 'more specifically' (subclassing)</p>
        <p>The focus control, and key events are clearly buggy.
            </p>
	    <h3>Things to try</h3>
	    <ul>
	        <li>Type something in the 'object' section of a new line.  Hit Enter.  New element added.</li>
	        <li>Create two lines.  In the second line, hit Tab (Shift tab) to indent (unindent) or attach the second line to the parent above.  (must actually hit twice).</li>
	        <li>Type something in the 'predicate' section of a line.  Autocomplete is turned on.  Select all then type 'e' to see the list of options.</li>
	        <li>Create a few nodes.  Then create child node.  Select 'more generally' as the predicate.  Then autocomplete on the object field is turned on and allows you to select any other node you have already created.</li>
	    </ul>
